<div style="text-align: center;">

And there we lay -  
Our souls entwined,  
Our bodies at waste;  
Passion lay dead in the tracks trodden by habit.  

You wouldn’t know.  
All words of love  
That had done us mellow –  
Colourful as the spring and sprightly as a swallow  
They seem now to be  
But the burnt remains of a plundered bee-hive,  
In black decay.  

All words of passion  
That could arouse us  
And let us loose as if a raging Spanish bull;  
All fantasies of the most beautiful and the artful,  
- now left none but thin air  
Reeking of the rotten carcasses  
Of our once-throbbing hearts.  

Every bullet,  
Every slogan,  
That had once set our faith aflame –  
Left nothing but grey ash.  

We lay in waste.  
You wouldn’t know.  

It was not a graveyard  
Sombre in death,  
For  

Every word truly once felt  
Now hung heavy  
In the mesh of dead poetry –  
Rotting,  
The pungent stench keeping the decaying bodies  
Alive in disuse and waste  
In the graveyard of dead poets.
